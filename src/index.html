                Hussars was a private army, very expensive to maintain. But they were worth it. They have not lost any battle for 100 years. Mainly princes and high nobility of the time could afford their dependents.
                
                The mercenaries of those years (1500-1625) reserved in their contracts that they will not take part in the battle in which the Polish Hussars are fighting. 
                  
                Husaria's strength was not in the weapon - strength was in honor and in very high morale. 
                The average hussar in combat gave 200% of his own abilities, because it was an honor to be a Hussar Each hussar was using his own assets to go on a war, because for the country, keeping this unit was a heavy burden. The dedication of these people has shaped the legend of this formation.

                Hussaria was primarily a horse riding spearmen. 
                So the basic method of her fight was a charge in a tight formation with copies, which were crushed on the opponent. When the copy was missing, they could fight like cuiriers (swordfish and firearms). In certain circumstances, the hussars dismounted from the horses, fighting as infantry using then shortened copies as a peak, or a long firearm.
                
                Hussars could, however, fulfill the tasks of other formations. The Hussars also took part in pre-made combat battles and in the pursuit of a shattered opponent. So it was a universal ride, but due to its high cost and specificity, it was most beneficial to use it for the tasks for which it was created, i.e. for breaking charges.

                But let's start from beginning. 100 years without being defeated? 
                This formation was not winning or losing battles, because they were never acting alone. Admittedly, there were cases when only a banner of hussars was charging - which was only part of the larger battle - not a whole fight. There were also few cases, when in a small skirmish the hussars actually fought alone, but these fights were marginal and could not be called a battle. 
                All the biggest victories counted on the account of hussars - Kircholm, Kłuszyn, Trzciana, Chocim or Vienna</p>
                
            </div>
      
        
        
            <div class="col s12 m12 l6 flow-text" style="padding-top: 25px">
                <p>
                They were equipped with armor, 5-6-meter copies, shields, skins of wild animals and characteristic wings. 
                Common theory is that the hussars wore the wings because they made a loud, clattering noise which made it seem like the cavalry was much larger than in reality and frightened the enemy's horses. 
                They attacked in full gallop. The attack of Husaria was usually the last one in enemy's life, an extremely terrifying sight, and for an outside observer he was beautiful and amazing.
                </p>
            </div>
            
    
        
      
           
            <div class="col s12 m12 l6 flow-text" style="padding-top: 25px">
                <p>
                <b>Why were they winning?</b> The causes were both complex and universal at the same time. 
                High hussar morale, very good equipment and training, great experience, good command ... These are the basic factors that helped each army and army formation in the history of wars. Some specificity of the hussars was that it continued the traditions of knighthood horse driving, when it was disappearing already in Europe. 
                Hence, in certain periods and certain wars it could have been a kind of novelty for an opponent with whom it came to fight. The element of surprise appearing in such a situation could be used appropriately. Typical is, that the hussars were performing their greatest successes when the opponent - not appreciating the hussars, or simply not knowing its capabilities - went out into the open field and tried to face it there.

                                Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, seeing that the Swedes are standing on the hill and knowing that their position can not be attacked, he decided to simulate a retreat by a hillside to trick the enemy.
                                Seeing the fleeing Poles and Lithuanians, Charles IX ordered the Swedes to follow the fleeing enemy. and chase a weak opponent. 
                                On the signal, the first Swedish infantry attack, protected from sides by the light horse cavalry, descended from the hill into a valley, and then began marching uphill, to the elevation occupied by the Polish-Lithuanian army. Chodkiewicz realized that the left wing of the Swedes is stronger than the right, so he decided to attack the weaker one.
                                When the first throw of the Swedish army departed from the rest of his army, Chodkiewicz stopped the simulated escape. The Swedes climbing uphill met unexpectedly with strong artillery and infantry fire.
                                
                                Subsequent waves of Swedish troops due to too long distance could not help the weakened side of Swedes which hussars and Kurdish cavalry has raided
                                
                                Also after a while the hussars and the Kurdish cavalry raided the Swedes from the side and due to too long distance, subsequent waves of Swedish troops could not help the attacked comrades.
                                
                                Thanks to the use of the ruse and the erroneous assessment of the situation of Charles IX, the Poles did not have to fight the whole Swedish army, but only half of it.

                                After several minutes of fighting with the hussars, the Swedes rushed to escape, mixing the reserves at the back. 
                                After defeating the reiters, the hussars attacked the infantry, and despite the defence of the light horse cavalry, the Sweedish troops has been quickly defeated.

                        Hussar horses had to be slightly heavier and taller. It is assumed that such a horse had to weigh just over 500kg. That weight results from the fact that the lighter horse could not cope with the high tasks posed before it under the hull weighing "gross" often exceeding 100kg. However, a heavier horse would not possess the required maneuverability and speed.

                       Hussars loved and appreciated their horses. They were realizing that many victories would not have been possible without a good horse. The loss of horses during the battle was usually very large. For example, in the battle of Kircholm, out of 300 horses of the first hit, 150 units left. In battles always more horses were dying than men.
